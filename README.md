# CSC423-DataAnalysisAndRegression
This repository  contains homework and a final project for CSC423, Data Analysis and Regression at DePaul University as taught by Bill Qualls in Fall of 2015.

Class description:
CSC423: Multiple regression and correlation, residual analysis, analysis of variance, and robustness. These topics will be studied from a data analytic perspective, supported by an investigation of available statistical software. 

The class used SAS and R. I used SAS for my homework assignments and R for our final group project.
